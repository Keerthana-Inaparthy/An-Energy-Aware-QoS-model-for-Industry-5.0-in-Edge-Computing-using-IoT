# An-Energy-Aware-QoS-model-for-Industry-5.0-in-Edge-Computing-using-IoT
In the current scenario of Industry 5.0, prioritizing safety in industries is crucial, 
especially as safeguarding both people and industrial machinery from potential dangers 
like extreme temperatures, high humidity, and harmful gases has become a top priority. 

The project aims to develop and implement an advanced safety monitoring and alert 
system tailored for industrial environments within the framework of Industry 5.0. The 
system aims to address critical safety concerns, including extreme temperatures, high 
humidity, and harmful gases such as CO2 and carbon monoxide. By leveraging cutting
edge energy-aware algorithms and Quality of Service (QoS) features, the project seeks to 
enhance the overall efficiency and reliability of industrial monitoring systems. Central to 
this initiative is the use of a NodeMCU device as the central cluster head, facilitating real
time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and air quality. 

Features:
● Real-Time Monitoring: Enable real-time monitoring of crucial 
environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air quality 
through dedicated sensors. 
● Reliable Communication: Establish robust communication protocols (e.g., 
HTTP) between devices for seamless and reliable data exchange. 
● Quality of Service Enhancement: Enhance Quality of Service (QoS) by 
providing timely alerts and updates on the centralized LED display and 
through the buzzer system.
